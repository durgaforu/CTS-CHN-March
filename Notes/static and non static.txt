static methods never access non sttaic data directly
non static methods (instance) access static and non static directly
static methods access only static data directly

-> non stataic methods accepts non static data and static data
-> static methods accepts only static data. non static data cannot be accepted directly
-> static data is sharable to all objects
-> non static data is personal to its own object
-> If any class contains non static data, then creation of an objectc is mandatary
   to access non sttaic data fron a static method
-> if any class contains static data, then creation of object is not nessasary to access it.
   static data can be called directly if it is available in the same class. 
-> If the static data is available in another class, then you must call that static data
   with class name where static data exists
