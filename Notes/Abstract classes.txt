Abstract classes
--------------------
-> An abstract class is a method specification which contains zero or more abstract methods 
   and concreate methods
-> An abstract method do not specify body. Its only specifiication/declaration
-> Only abstract class contains abstract methods
-> All sub classes of an abstract class must override/implement all abstract methods
   defined in the abstract class.
-> If any sub class of an abstract class is not overriding / implementing any one of 
   abstract methods of an abstract class, then that sub class must be defined as 'abstract'
-> We cannot create object to an abstract class, but we can create a reference variable to 
  an abstract class.
-> Abstract class reference can store all its implementation/sub classes objects
-> An abstract class cannot be defined as final
